**Project Title: LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM** 

**The project is about to make an efficient library management system that will handle and store the data of members and books using object-oriented programming.** 

**-> Code Structure:** 

**The code of the project contains four classes named Library, Members, Books, and Main.** 

1. **The Members class is used to store the data of a user; we are storing the information of members as class attributes and handling the issueBook(), returnBook, etc. functionality.** 
1. **The Book class is used to store the data of a book; we are storing the information of books (example: title, author, issueDate, etc.) as class attributes.** 
1. **The library class is used to handle libraries as a librarian, and that will handle both the member and book classes. The Library class contains three array lists that store the objects of the member class and book class. The first arrayList contains the members, the second contains all books, and the third contains all the available books for issue.** 
1. **The main class is used to maintain user interference and handle user inputs. The main class takes input from the user and calls other classes functions according to user requirements. I have also done some user-friendly error handling that will show some error messages when input is not correct.**
